jagger is a Java application monitoring tool using JMX technology
to aggregate, archive and visualize monitoring data for larger computer
clusters, giving developers and administrators both a succinct and
comprehensive view into their systems, which normal JMX consoles cannot do
due to information overflow.

the "LICENSE.txt" file.

For instructions on how to install the software on your computer, read
"INSTALL.txt".

If you plan to hack away at the sources, see "docs/BUILD.txt" for some hints
