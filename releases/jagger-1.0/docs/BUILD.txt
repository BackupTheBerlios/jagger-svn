PROJECT ORGANIZATION
--------------------

The project's root contains the most important documentation any user will need, and the files necessary to build it.
Most notably is "build.gant", which contains the build instructions, and "build.properties" for its configuration.

The file "jagger.properties" is a sample cluster configuration file
which can be used for testing, but it's also possible to test using
command line parameters (the obvious choice if you're not the main
developer). 

Subdirectories:
    bin                 Shell wrappers
    docs                Documentation and project website
    lib                 A place for additional JARs (see building notes below)
    src/conf            Sample configuration files
    src/groovy          Groovy source tree (compiled 2nd)
    src/java            Java source tree (compiled 1st)
    tests_src/groovy    Groovy unit test source tree
    tests_src/java      Java unit test source tree

The package structure is in "de.web.tools.jagger", with the following layout:
    de.web.tools.jagger                 External interface (command line)
    de.web.tools.jagger.console         Terminal display handling
    de.web.tools.jagger.console.panels  Different types of display panels
    de.web.tools.jagger.jmx             JMX support
    de.web.tools.jagger.util            Utility classes


BUILDING JAGGER
---------------

"gant build" creates a distribution structure in "target/jagger-X.X".
The build script uses some ant-contrib tasks, so make sure your
environment is configured accordingly (the newest gant releases are
supposed to do this automatically). 

Dependencies needed by jagger (currently Spring) are downloaded once
from the Maven repository and are cached in a directory named
".buildcache". "gant clean" deletes the "target" directory, but NOT the
download cache. If you ever want to do that, manually remove the
".buildcache" directory. 

"gant doc" works only with Groovy 1.1 and creates the API documentation.
If you use 1.1, it's also automatically packed into the source release. 


RELEASING JAGGER
----------------

"gant release" builds both the source (gant dist) and the binary (gant
package) distribution archives, in three different package formats.
