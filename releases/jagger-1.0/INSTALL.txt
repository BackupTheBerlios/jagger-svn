Jagger Quick Installation Guide
===============================

Possibly more thorough and up to date instructions can be found on
http://openfacts.berlios.de/index-en.phtml?title=Jagger_Installation


Installing Java and Groovy
--------------------------

I assume that the intended audience of Jagger, namely administrators
and developers, are able to install a JVM and Groovy on their own.

Jagger is tested with Sun Java 1.6.0 and Groovy 1.0 and 1.1-beta-2. When
installing Groovy, don't forget to remove "mx4j-*.jar" from the "lib"
directory, since this is not needed for newer JVMs and actually prevents
JMX code from running correctly on them.

If you want to build from source, you'll also need to have Gant available.
Other dependencies are downloaded as needed, during building (i.e. you need
an internet connection, at least once).

Download sources:
 * http://www.java.com/en/download/manual.jsp
 * http://groovy.codehaus.org/Download
 * http://groovy.codehaus.org/Gant


Installing the binary distribution
----------------------------------

The binary distribution of Jagger contains everything it needs to run,
except Java and Groovy. It always unpacks to a versioned directory. The
distribution archives are available from

   http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=8650

After you downloaded and unpacked your preferred archive format, change
into the "jagger-X.X" directory and test your installation by calling

   bin/jagger -n YOURHOSTNAME:YOURJMXPORT -u YOURJMXUSER -w YOURJMXPWD

using appropriate values for your environment, of course. Before doing
so, please make sure the target JMX connection works by connecting using
jconsole.

When you made sure everything works as you expect, you can install jagger
permanently onto your system by simply copying everything to /usr, /usr/local
or any other place you desire, since the archive contents follow the standard
UNIX layout. For /usr/local this would be

   cp -ar . /usr/local


Installing the source distribution
----------------------------------

If you installed all prerequisites (Java, Groovy, Gant), building
Jagger requires very few steps:

 * download one of the source archives from BerliOS, see
   http://developer.berlios.de/project/showfiles.php?group_id=8650

 * unpack the archive (will always unpack into a versioned directory)

 * go into that directory and call "gant package"

 * you'll get a binary package in "target", install according to the
   above instructions


Have fun and enjoy!
